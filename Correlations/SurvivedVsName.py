#The purpose for this script is to find the correlation between the variable 
#'Name' and 'Survived' in our dataset, we will use the length of the name as a way
#to quantify the variable name

#1.1 - Working with our two columns

df = df[['Survived','Name']]


#1.2 - Meassuring the length of the names in our name column

# 1.3 - Meassuring correlation between the length of the names and the Survived 
# status datapoints using Point-Biserial Correlation. 

# The Point-Biserial Correlation is a statistical measure used to determine 
# the relationship between a binary variable (e.g., 0/1, yes/no) and a continuous variable.
